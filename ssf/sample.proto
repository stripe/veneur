// SSFSpan is the primary unit of reporting in SSF. It embeds a set of
// SSFSamples, as well as start/stop time stamps and a parent ID
// (which allows assembling a span lineage for distributed tracing
// purposes).
//
// Note that since this is protobuf, an SSFSpan does not *have* to
// include metrics, just as it does not *have* to include information
// necessary to reconstruct a trace.
//
// Compatibility
//
// On ingestion, an SSFSpan with an empty string for a name field but
// a tag "name" will have that name field replaced with the name tag,
// and the tag is removed.
//
// Metric SSFSamples with a zero sample_rate (indicating it was left
// out) have the sample_rate field set to 1 on ingestion.
//
// Validity Criteria
//
// Programs consuming SSFSpans should take care to only process spans
// and metrics that fulfill the following criteria:
//
// Metrics are considered valid if they have a name and a value.
//
// SSFSpans are considered valid trace spans if they have non-zero id,
// trace_id, start_timestamp and end_timestamp fields.

  // span, and its child spans would further describe its duration.
