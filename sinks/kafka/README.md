# Kafka Sink

The Kafka sink allows flushing of metrics or spans to to a [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) topic.

# Configuration

See the various `kafka_*` keys in [example.yaml](https://github.com/stripe/veneur/blob/master/example.yaml) for all available configuration options. This sink supports the following features:

# Status

**This sink is stable**. Some some encoding or options may change. This sink is in active development.

## TODO

* Uses the async client, but doesn't currently do anything on failure.
* Does not currently handle writes of events or checks

* batching
* ack requirements
* publishing of Protobuf or JSON formatted messages

## Span Sampling

The Kafka sink supports span sampling! By default, setting `kafka_span_sample_rate_percent`
less than 100 will sample based off of traceId (meaning that if one span with a particular
traceId is selected, all spans with that traceId will be selected), but that behavior
can be configured to use a tag instead via `kafka_span_sample_tag`. For example,

```
kafka_span_sample_tag: "request_id"
kafka_span_sample_rate_percent: 75
```

With this configuration, spans _without_ the `"request_id"` tag will be rejected,
and spans _with_ the `"request_id"` will be sampled at 75%, based off of a hash
of their `"request_id"` value; in this way, you can sample all values relevant to
a particular tag value.

# Format

Metrics are published in JSON in the form of:

```
{
  "name": "some.metric",
  "timestamp": 1234567, // unix time
  "value": 1.0,
  "tags": [ "tag:value", â€¦ ],
  "type": "gauge" // counter, etc
}
```

Spans are published in one of JSON or Protobuf. The form is defined in [SSF's protobuf and codegen output](https://github.com/stripe/veneur/tree/master/ssf). Note that it has a `version` field for compatibility in the future.
