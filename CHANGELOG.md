# 1.6.0, pending

## Added
* Veneur-emit can now time any shell command and emit its duration as a Timing metric. Thanks [redsn0w422](https://github.com/redsn0w422)!
* Config options can now be provided via environment variables using [envconfig](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/envconfig) for veneur and veneur-proxy. Thanks [gphat](https://github.com/gphat)!
* [SSF](https://github.com/stripe/veneur/tree/master/ssf) now includes a boolean `indicator` field for signaling that this span is useful as a [Service Level Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_level_indicator) for it's service.
* A type `SSFSpanCollection` has been added but is not yet used.

## Improvements
* If possible, initialization errors when starting Veneur will now be reported to Sentry. Thanks [chimeracoder](https://github.com/chimeracoder)!
* Check return value of LightStep flush. Thanks [chimeracoder](https://github.com/chimeracoder)!
* No longer using a fork of [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) that fixed a race condition. Thanks [chimeracoder](https://github.com/chimeracoder)!
* Updated to latest version of [LightStep's tracing library](https://github.com/lightstep/lightstep-tracer-go), which drastically improves the success of spans on hosts with high span rates. Thanks [gphat](https://github.com/gphat)!
* No longer buffers spans for LightStep, they are dispatched directly to the LightStep client. Thanks [gphat](https://github.com/gphat)!
* Reuse an existing buffer when parsing incoming spans, reducing allocations. Thanks [gphat](https://github.com/gphat)!
* Use [gogo protobuf](https://github.com/gogo/protobuf) for code generation of SSF's protobuf, resulting in faster and less memory span ingestion. Thanks [gphat](https://github.com/gphat)!

## Bugfixes
* veneur-proxy no longer balks at using static hosts for tracing and metrics. Thanks [gphat](https://github.com/gphat)!

## Deprecations
* [SSF](https://github.com/stripe/veneur/tree/master/ssf)'s `operation` field has been deprecated in favor of the field `name`.
* SSF spans with a tag `name` will have that name placed into the SSF span `name` field until 2.0 is released.

# 1.5.2, 2017-08-15

## Bugfixes
* Correctly parse `Set` metrics if sent via SSF. Thanks [redsn0w422](https://github.com/redsn0w422)!

* Don't panic if a packet doesn't have tags. Thanks [redsn0w422](https://github.com/redsn0w422)!
* Fix a typo in the link to veneur-emit in the readme. Thanks [vasi](https://github.com/vasi)!

## Added

* Switch to [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep/) for managing the `vendor` directory. Thanks [chimeracoder](https://github.com/chimeracoder)!
* Remove support for `govendor`. Thanks [chimeracoder](https://github.com/chimeracoder)!
* Emit GC metrics at flush time. This feature is best used with Go 1.9 as previous versions cause GC pauses when collecting this information from go. Thanks [gphat](https://github.com/gphat)!
* Allow configuration of LightStep's reconnect period via `trace_lightstep_reconnect_period` and the maximum number of spans it will buffer via `trace_lightstep_maximum_spans`. Thanks [gphat](https://github.com/gphat)!
* Switch to [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep/) for managing the `vendor` directory. Thanks [chimeracoder](https://github.com/chimeracoder)!
* Remove support for `govendor`. Thanks [chimeracoder](https://github.com/chimeracoder)!
* Added [harmonic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean) as an optional aggregate type. Use `hmean` as an option to the `aggregates` config option to enable. Thanks [non](https://github.com/non)!

# 1.3.0, 2017-05-19

## Bugfixes
* No longer allow clients to pass in `nan`, `+inf` or `-inf` as a value for a metric, as this caused errors on flush. Thanks [gphat](https://github.com/gphat)!

## Added

## Changes
* Refactor tests to use a more shareable test fixture. Thanks [evanj](https://github.com/evanj)!
* Refactor `Server`'s constructor to not start any goroutines and add a `Start()` that takes care of that, making for easier tests.

## Bugfixes
