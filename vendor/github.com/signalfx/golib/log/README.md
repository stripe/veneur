# golib logging

A logging abstraction.  Borrowed from go-kit/log and restructued for a log interface that does not
return an error.  The original go-kit/log code is covered under MIT (See LICENSE_gokit) with modifications covered
under this repositories license file.

Some of go-kit's tests have been copied directly into this repository and renamed as "kit*_test.go".
