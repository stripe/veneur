/*
Package config provides a configuration surface area for configuring the underlying
client.

Authentication

You will need a valid API key to communicate with the backend New Relic APIs
that power the client.  Using a Personal API key is the preferred method
but an Admin API key is required for several different resource types.  Check each
package's documentation for more information on which key is required. See the API
key documentation below for more information on how to locate these keys:
