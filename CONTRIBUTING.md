Contributing to Veneur
=================

Thanks for contributing to Veneur!

This is a short document letting you know what you can expect when submitting a patch.

## Getting Started

Check out [Developing in Veneur](https://github.com/stripe/veneur/blob/master/docs/development.md)!

## Code Review

All pull requests will be reviewed by someone on Stripe's Observability team. At present, those users are:

* aditya-stripe (aka chimeracoder)
* asf-stripe
* cory-stripe (aka gphat)
* joshu-stripe
* krisreeves-stripe

There's no need to pick a reviewer; if you submit a pull request, we'll see it and figure out who should review it.

If your pull request involves large or sensitive changes, it will probably need to be reviewed by either Aditya Mukerjee (chimeracoder || aditya-stripe) or Cory Watson (cory-stripe || gphat).

For larger changes, there may be a delay in reviewing/merging if Aditya or Cory is unavailable, or if we need to complete merge some other related work first as a prerequisite. If you have any questions along the way, though, feel free to ask on the thread, and we'll be happy to help out.

## Help us help you!

We highly recommend [allowing edits from maintainers](https://help.github.com/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork/) (ie, us) to your branch. Since Veneur is actively developed, there's a good chance that other pull requests will have been merged in between when you submit a pull request and when we approve it. Allowing us to edit your branch means that we can rebase and fix any merge conflicts for you.
