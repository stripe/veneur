`veneur-prometheus` is a command line utility for periodically polling
[a Prometheus metrics endpoint](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/)
and passing those metrics along to an instance of Veneur.

## SSF

At present these metrics are emitting as DogStatsD style metrics. We will add SSF at a later date.
