# == COLLECTION ==

# The addresses on which to listen for statsd metrics. These are
# formatted as URLs, with schemes corresponding to valid "network"
# arguments on https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Listen. Currently, only udp,
# tcp(including IPv4 and 6-only) and unixgram(datagram only) schemes are
# supported. This option supersedes the "udp_address" and "tcp_address" options.
statsd_listen_addresses:
 - udp://localhost:8126
 - tcp://localhost:8126
 - unixgram:///tmp/veneur-statsd.sock
 - unixgram:@veneur-statsd.sock

# The addresses on which to listen for SSF data. As with
# statsd_listen_addresses, these are formatted as URLs, with schemes
# corresponding to valid "network" arguments on
# https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Listen. Currently, only UDP and Unix
# domain sockets are supported.
# Note: SSF sockets are required to ingest trace data.
# This option supersedes the "ssf_address" option.

# The addresses on which to listen for GRPC encoded SSF or dogstatsd data. As with
# statsd_listen_addresses, these are formatted as URLs, with schemes
# corresponding to valid "network" arguments on
# https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Listen. Only TCP addresses are supported.
# This option can be used in conjunction with ssf_listen_addresses and statsd_listen_addresses.
# Each address listed here can support both SSF and dogstatsd on the same address and same port (the wonders of gRPC).
grpc_listen_addresses:

# value when you've already emitted metrics will break your time
# series data.

# Veneur can "sychronize" it's flushes with the system clock, flushing at even
# intervals i.e. 0, 10, 20… to align with the `interval`. This is disabled by
# default for now, as it can cause thundering herds in large installations.
synchronize_with_interval: false

# Veneur emits its own metrics; this configures where we send them. It's ok
# to point veneur at itself for metrics consumption!
# This can be host:port combination or a Unix Domain Socket(eg: unix:///tmp/veneur-statsd.sock)

# Metrics that Veneur reports about its own operation. Each of the
# entries here can have the value "global", "local", "default" and ""
# ("default" and "" mean the same thing). Setting
# this to any value other than the default will make all metrics
# of that type have the following behavior:
#
#  - "default"/"": scope remains unchanged
#  - "global": scope for "default"-scoped metrics of that type will be
#    changed to global, so they get forwarded to a global veneur node.
#  - "local": scope for "default"-scoped metrics of that type will be
#    changed to local, so they get reported from the local veneur node
#    only.
#
# When this is unset in configuration, the default values for all
# metric types are "", indicating that veneur will use the default
# scope for each of the metrics it reports.

# == PERFORMANCE ==

# Adjusts the number of metrics workers across which Veneur will
# distribute aggregation.  More decreases contention but has
# diminishing returns. The default value is 1, no parallel ingestion
# of metrics.
num_workers: 96

# Adjusts the number of listening goroutines on any UDP listener

# Adjusts the number of spans that can be accomodated before the span
# ingestion buffer blocks. This is good to tweak when you're seeing
# spiky span ingestion patterns and a lot of spans get dropped. This
