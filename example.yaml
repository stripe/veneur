# == COLLECTION ==

# The addresses on which to listen for statsd metrics. These are
# formatted as URLs, with schemes corresponding to valid "network"
# arguments on https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Listen. Currently, only udp
# and tcp (including IPv4 and 6-only) schemes are supported.
# This option supersedes the "udp_address" and "tcp_address" options.

# The addresses on which to listen for SSF data. As with
# statsd_listen_addresses, these are formatted as URLs, with schemes
# corresponding to valid "network" arguments on
# https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Listen. Currently, only UDP and Unix
# domain sockets are supported.
# Note: SSF sockets are required to ingest trace data.
# This option supersedes the "ssf_address" option.

# Veneur can "sychronize" it's flushes with the system clock, flushing at even
# intervals i.e. 0, 10, 20… to align with the `interval`. This is disabled by
# default for now, as it can cause thundering herds in large installations.

# - `max`: the maximum value in the histogram during the flush period
# - `median`: the median value in the histogram during the flush period
# - `avg`: the average value in the histogram during the flush period
# - `count`: the number of values added to the histogram during the flush period
# - `sum`: the sum of all values added to the histogram during the flush period
# - `hmean`: the harmonic mean of the all the values added to the histogram during the flush period
aggregates:
 - "min"
 - "max"
 - "count"
